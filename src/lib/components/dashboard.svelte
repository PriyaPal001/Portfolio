					Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my full projects list here. I also do some generative-art, compform, interactivity experiments on 100.antfu.me.

					Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on Instagram. If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Paris), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.
